            <p>A cryptocurrency (colloquially crypto) is a digital currency designed to work through a computer network that
                <br> is not reliant on any central authority, such as a government or bank, to uphold or maintain it.

                Individual coin ownership records are stored in a digital
                <br> ledger or blockchain, which is a computerized
                <br> database that uses a consensus mechanism to secure transaction records,
                <br> control the creation of additional
                <br> coins, and verify the transfer of coin 
                <br>The two most common consensus mechanisms are proof of
                <br> work and proof of stake. Despite the name, which has come
                <br> to describe many of the fungible blockchain tokens
                <br> that have been created, cryptocurrencies are not considered to be currencies
                <br> in the traditional sense,
                <br> and varying legal treatments have been applied to them 
                <br>in various jurisdicitons, including classification as
                <br> commodities, securities, and currencies. Cryptocurrencies
                <br> are generally viewed as a distinct asset class in practice.
                <br>

                The first cryptocurrency was bitcoin, which was first released as open-source software in 2009. As of June 2023,
                <br> there were more than 25,000 other cryptocurrencies in the marketplace, of which more than 40 had a market
                <br> capitalization exceeding $1 billion.[10] As of April 2025, the cryptocurrency market capitalization was
                <br> already estimated at $2.76 trillion.</p>
